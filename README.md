# End-to-End-User-Addition-and-Search
My first try at developing a full stack basic app. The Technology stack includes HTML,CSS,Javascript,Jquery,Node,MongoDB.

# Synopsis
This application allows to enter the first name, last name and email for someone and stores it to the Mongo Database. We can then retrive it using another feature where you can search on the basis of the email.

# How to Run

1. Clone this Repository and get the files.
2. Make sure you have MongoDB(at localport 27017) and Node.js globally.
3. Run this command : 'npm install' in the directory where these files are stored.
      Running this command would include the 'node_modules' folder along with the installation of the dependencies mentioned         in the package.json file.
4. Hit localhost:3000 in the browser, you should be taken to the home page.
